Database Insertions

This notebook will help you insert and download data to and from your database

Functionalities:
    1. Download all relations as separate CSV files and save them into the WD/DownloadFiles
    2. Insert into your database from separate CSV files for each relation
    3. Truncate all tables in the schema
    4. Save output of queries as Pandas Dataframes
    

For getting a template of CSV files for each relation, you may want to use the download functionality and then insert the data back after
truncating each relation
